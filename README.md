# Spring CRUD Operations

This project demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using the Spring framework. It includes endpoints for managing entities in a database, such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting records. The project serves as a foundational example for building RESTful APIs with Spring Boot, showcasing best practices for implementing data persistence and business logic in a Java-based web application.

## Features

- Create: Add new records to the database.
- Read: Retrieve existing records from the database.
- Update: Modify existing records in the database.
- Delete: Remove records from the database.
- RESTful API: Expose endpoints for interacting with the CRUD operations.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- Hibernate
- MySQL (or your preferred database)
- Maven (or Gradle for dependency management)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Java and Maven installed on your system.
3. Configure the application.properties file with your database connection details.
4. Run the application using Maven:


5. Access the application at `http://localhost:8080` (or the port specified in your application.properties).

## Usage

- Use Postman or any REST client to interact with the CRUD endpoints.
- Send HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD operations on the entities.
